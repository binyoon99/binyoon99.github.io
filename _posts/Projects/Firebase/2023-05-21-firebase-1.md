## Posting Items/Buy Items/Chating with buyer/seller website with logins 

 https://naturecat.ca/login.html

 - Shutdown the website because I couldn't find a way to hide my api keys.
- using environment varibale and local env (.env and process.env.APIKEY) didn't work
-  I assume it is because Im using vanila js?


## what's next?
I will develop the project in next.js with using supabase (it's like firebase but free and open source).

## When?
I have few projects I want to do ahead of this one like github, and chatgpt.
Approximate start date will be May 2023.
